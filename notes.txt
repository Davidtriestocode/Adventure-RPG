- Added an embedded version of python in the folder with numpy and pygame installed to make it more portable. Created start.bat to run the game easier from a shortcut (for linux users could add a .sh file).
- Python is very versatile and not very "strict", there are not many rules with how you should form and organise your code it just might not work, so, I will probably use the words class to refer to modules and methods instead of functions as I am more used to those and I believe they are more generic.
- For classes to work correctly they need to have lower coupling and higher cohesion. Coupling is how much a class relies on other classes, it is better for a class to have low coupling and be independant from other classes so you can reuse it easily with other classes without it failing because other classes have gone or changed. Cohesion is how much the methods relate and work with each other within a class. As an example, it is best to keep character.py purely for stats, and functions relating to changing the character stats. Other functions such as graphics could go in another, movement another etc. However this is a big part of the planning.
